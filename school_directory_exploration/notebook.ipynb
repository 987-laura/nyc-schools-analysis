    "**1. There is a strong imbalance in school distribution across boroughs.**\n",
    "  - Brooklyn has the highest number of schools (121), followed closely by the Bronx (118), while Staten Island has by far the fewest schools (10). \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Average student enrollment per school shows an inverse pattern to school counts.**\n",
    "  - Boroughs with fewer schools tend to have larger schools on average. Staten Island (10 schools) and Queens (80 schools) have the highest average student populations per school, while the Bronx (118 schools) has the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Grade span structures are highly consistent across boroughs.** \n",
    " - Nearly all schools extend to Grade 12, with only minor variation in lower grade boundaries, indicating a standardized upper-grade offering citywide."
